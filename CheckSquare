We can also eliminate certain wrong answers, but we need to be intelligent in
where are we searching. If the top most grid is empty or labelled '0', we do not 
want to search anything above it (because there is nothing)

[STRATEGY]

if row is from 0 to 2:
 column is from 0 to 2:
  then check from row[0 to 2], column [0 to 2]
  
  in other words, it is used to checkif rows and column falls within the range, then check within the suitable ranges
   for for e.g[board][3][7]
    then check board[3-5][6-8]
    
    so in general, from index:
      0,1,2 check 0 to 2
      3,4,5 check 3 to 5
      6,7,8 check 4 to 8
